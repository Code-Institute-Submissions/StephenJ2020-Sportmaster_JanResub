# Project Overview 
___ 
## Project Description   
**Code Institute: Full Stack Frameworks with Django - Milestone 4 Project**   
   
The Milestone 4 project assignment is to build a full-stack site based around business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset.  To set up an authentication mechanism and provide paid access to the site's data and/or other activities based on the dataset, such as the purchase of a product/service. I have the option to choose from one of the following two scenarios or to come up with my own idea:   
. Build a Ô¨Åtness subscription application     
. Build a site to sell your graphic design services   
    
I have decided to create an eCommerce site for a local sports shop called Sportmaster.  This is a small family run business who don't currently have a website but they did use Facebook during the various pandemic related lockdowns to offer a "click & collect" service.  This highlighted to me their clear need for a fully functioning eCommerce website.
   
## Project Requirements   
 
### Main Technologies   
. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Django    
  
. Relational database (recommending MySQL or Postgres)  
  
. Stripe payments    
  
. Additional libraries and APIs    
          
  
### Mandatory Requirements       
1. Django Full Stack Project: Build a Django project backend by a relational database to create a website that allows users to store and manipulate data records about a particular domain.   
2. Multiple Apps: The project must be a brand new Django project, composed of multiple apps (an app for each potentially reusable component in your project).   
3. Data Modeling: Put some effort into designing a relational database schema well-suited for your domain. Make sure to put some thought into the relationships between entities. Create at least 2 custom django models beyond the examples shown on the course (changing the field names of the miniproject models is not customisation)   
4. User Authentication: The project should include an authentication mechanism, allowing a user to register and log in, and there should be a good reason as to why the users would need to do so. e.g., a user would have to register to persist their shopping cart between sessions (otherwise it would be lost).    
5. User Interaction: Include at least one form with validation that will allow users to create and edit models in the backend (in addition to the authentication mechanism).   
6. Use of Stripe: At least one of your Django apps should contain some e-commerce functionality using Stripe. This may be a shopping cart checkout or single payments, or donations, etc. After paying successfully, the user would then gain access to additional functionality/content on the site. Note that for this project you should use Stripe's test functionality, rather than actual live payments.   
7. Structure and Navigation: Incorporate a main navigation menu and structured layout (you might want to use Bootstrap to accomplish this).   
8. Use of JavaScript: The frontend should contain some JavaScript logic you have written to enhance the user experience.   
9. Documentation: Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the value that it provides to its users.   
10. Version Control: Use Git & GitHub for version control.   
11. Attribution: Maintain clear separation between code written by you and code from external sources (e.g. libraries or tutorials). Attribute any code from external sources to its source via comments above the code and (for larger dependencies) in the README.   
12. Deployment: Deploy the final version of your code to a hosting platform such as Heroku.    
13. Security: Make sure to not include any passwords or secret keys in the project repository. Make sure to turn off the Django DEBUG mode, which could expose secrets.

### Color Scheme  
  
I have chosen a very bright and vibrant colour palette to reflect the active and sporty nature of the products being sold via the site by Sportmaster.  Plus the sporting colours of the local Celbridge G.A.A. and football teams are white and blue so my colour scheme reflects this.

To create the color palette I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/).

**Bugs and fixes to go here**  

* Dropdown menus in Navbar not working:  
 - I had been using the Bootstrap 4 classes rather than the updated Bootstrap 5 classes.  
   - Thankfully I found a very helpful post on Slack by Vera which made me realise my error.  
   ![Slack Post](static/readme/bug-data-bs-toggle.png)  
  
* Media files not loading after deployment to Heroku and AWS:  
 - I needed to update the src file path from /media/image-name.jpg to {{ MEDIA_URL }}image-name.jpg  
   - I found the solution to this bug on slack.  
   ![Slack Post](static/readme/load-media-images.png)  

* jQuery not working properly with Bootstrap 5:  
 - The increase / decrease button and the update and remove buttons in the shopping bag wouldn't work properly.  
  - I search Slack for solutions and I looked at the Bootstrap documentation but I couldn't find a suitable solution. It appearead from Slack that many students have faced the same issue and that many had choosen to remove the increase / decrease buttons on desktop devices as their solution as the issue seems to be a duplicate ID with the Mobile Navbar.  
  I chose to strip out Bootstrap 5 and revert to Bootstrap 4 as per the Boutigue Ado Walk-Through project.  
    
* CountyField on Models.py in checkout app cause a migration error:

This project was deployed to ..........
  
  
## Making a clone to run locally  
  
It is important to note that this project will not run locally unless an env.py file has been set up by the user which contains the IP, PORT, MONGO_DBNAME, MONGO_URI and SECRET_KEY which have all been kept secret in keeping with best security practices.  
  
1. Log into GitHub.
