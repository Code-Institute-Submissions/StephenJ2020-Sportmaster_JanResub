# Project Overview 
___ 
## Project Description   
**Code Institute: Full Stack Frameworks with Django - Milestone 4 Project**   
   
The Milestone 4 project assignment is to build a full-stack site based around business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset.  To set up an authentication mechanism and provide paid access to the site's data and/or other activities based on the dataset, such as the purchase of a product/service. I have the option to choose from one of the following two scenarios or to come up with my own idea:   
. Build a Ô¨Åtness subscription application     
. Build a site to sell your graphic design services   
    
I have decided to create a   
   
## Project Requirements   
 
### Main Technologies   
. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Django    
  
. Relational database (recommending MySQL or Postgres)  
  
. Stripe payments    
  
. Additional libraries and APIs    
          
  
### Mandatory Requirements       
1. Django Full Stack Project: Build a Django project backend by a relational database to create a website that allows users to store and manipulate data records about a particular domain.   
2. Multiple Apps: The project must be a brand new Django project, composed of multiple apps (an app for each potentially reusable component in your project).   
3. Data Modeling: Put some effort into designing a relational database schema well-suited for your domain. Make sure to put some thought into the relationships between entities. Create at least 2 custom django models beyond the examples shown on the course (changing the field names of the miniproject models is not customisation)   
4. User Authentication: The project should include an authentication mechanism, allowing a user to register and log in, and there should be a good reason as to why the users would need to do so. e.g., a user would have to register to persist their shopping cart between sessions (otherwise it would be lost).    
5. User Interaction: Include at least one form with validation that will allow users to create and edit models in the backend (in addition to the authentication mechanism).   
6. Use of Stripe: At least one of your Django apps should contain some e-commerce functionality using Stripe. This may be a shopping cart checkout or single payments, or donations, etc. After paying successfully, the user would then gain access to additional functionality/content on the site. Note that for this project you should use Stripe's test functionality, rather than actual live payments.   
7. Structure and Navigation: Incorporate a main navigation menu and structured layout (you might want to use Bootstrap to accomplish this).   
8. Use of JavaScript: The frontend should contain some JavaScript logic you have written to enhance the user experience.   
9. Documentation: Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the value that it provides to its users.   
10. Version Control: Use Git & GitHub for version control.   
11. Attribution: Maintain clear separation between code written by you and code from external sources (e.g. libraries or tutorials). Attribute any code from external sources to its source via comments above the code and (for larger dependencies) in the README.   
12. Deployment: Deploy the final version of your code to a hosting platform such as Heroku.    
13. Security: Make sure to not include any passwords or secret keys in the project repository. Make sure to turn off the Django DEBUG mode, which could expose secrets.

## Making a clone to run locally  
  
It is important to note that this project will not run locally unless an env.py file has been set up by the user which contains the IP, PORT, MONGO_DBNAME, MONGO_URI and SECRET_KEY which have all been kept secret in keeping with best security practices.  
  
1. Log into GitHub.  
2. Select the [respository](https://github.com/StephenJ2020/Sportmaster).    
3. Click the Code dropdown button next to the green Gitpod button.  
4. Download ZIP file and unpackage locally and open with IDE. Alternatively copy the URL in the HTTPS box.  
6. Type 'git clone' and paste the copied URL.  
7. Press Enter. A local clone will be created.  
  
Once the project been loaded into the IDE it is necessary to install the necessary requirements which can be done by typing the following command.  
  
    -pip install -r requirements.txt  
  
    
## How to Fork the respository  
  
By forking the GitHub Repository you make a copy of the original repository on your own GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by following these simple steps:  
  
1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [StephenJ2020/Sportmaster Repository](https://github.com/StephenJ2020/Sportmaster)  
2. Near the top of the Repository, on the right-hand side of the screen, locate the "Fork" button.  
3. Click this button and you should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.  
    
## Making a Local Clone
