## Making a clone to run locally  
  
It is important to note that this project will not run locally unless an env.py file has been set up by the user which contains the IP, PORT, MONGO_DBNAME, MONGO_URI and SECRET_KEY which have all been kept secret in keeping with best security practices.  
  
1. Log into GitHub.  
2. Select the [respository](https://github.com/StephenJ2020/Sportmaster).    
3. Click the Code dropdown button next to the green Gitpod button.  
4. Download ZIP file and unpackage locally and open with IDE. Alternatively copy the URL in the HTTPS box.  
6. Type 'git clone' and paste the copied URL.  
7. Press Enter. A local clone will be created.  
  
Once the project been loaded into the IDE it is necessary to install the necessary requirements which can be done by typing the following command.  
  
    -pip install -r requirements.txt  
  
    
## How to Fork the respository  
  
By forking the GitHub Repository you make a copy of the original repository on your own GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by following these simple steps:  
  
1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [StephenJ2020/Sportmaster Repository](https://github.com/StephenJ2020/Sportmaster)  
2. Near the top of the Repository, on the right-hand side of the screen, locate the "Fork" button.  
3. Click this button and you should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.  
    
## Making a Local Clone 
  
1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [StephenJ2020/Sportmaster Repository](https://github.com/StephenJ2020/Sportmaster)  
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".  
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.  
4. Open Git Bash  
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.  
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.
